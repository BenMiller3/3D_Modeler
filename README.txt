# 3GC3 Assignment 3

By: Benjamin Miller and Jack Snopek

## Usage:

Click an object to select it, once selected:

	x = translate x
	y = translate y
	z = translate z

	a = rotate about x
	s = rotate about y
	w = rotate about z

	i = stretch x 
	j = stretch y
	k = stretch z

Shift inverts the command, so A will rotate x in the opposite direction.

	q = quit program

	s = save configuration

	l = load file from save

To CREATE an object press the following keys to create the following objects:

	6 = Cone
	7 = Sphere
	8 = Cube
	9 = Torus
	0 = Teapot

To change the objects material, select it and press the following keys for the following material selections:

	1 = Ruby (Default)
	2 = Emerald
	3 = Pearl
	4 = Yellow Rubber
	5 = Cyan Plastic

To delete an object from the scene, select it with the mouse and then right click the object to delete it.

To ROTATE the entire scene use the following keys:

	d = rotate about y axis
	f = rotate about z axis

Use the SHIFT modifier plus d or f to rotate in the opposite direction

To RESET the scene use the 'r' key. This will restore the scene to its original values and remove all objects created in the scene.

Press q at anytime to quit the program.

** BONUS FEATURE **

Use the Arrow Keys LEFT and RIGHT to zoom in and out of the X camera values
Use the Arrow Keys UP and DOWN to zoom in and out of the Y camera values
Use the n key to zoom out of the Z camera values and use SHIFT to reverse
***

-- Currently the rotate scene messes with the ray picking values so the values sometimes don't work. Press r to restart the scene and this fixes it.
